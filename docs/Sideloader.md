# Sideloader V
Sideloader V is a total conversion of the Vufine wearable display.

It uses all of the electronics which you get when buying the device.

It also features the semi-transparent combiner which lets you see the reflected image layed over the physical environment.

It uses HadesVR SteamVR driver to mirror-flip the video feed so that it can be viewed properly on the semi-transparent combiner in front of your eye.

It's also fitted with my custom SteamVR core board which has built-in gyroscope. This let's you move your head around in virtual environment and see the movements in the physical space.
