# Controllers

This is the place for everyone who would want to build their own HadesVR controllers.

HadesVR supports two kinds of controllers as of right now: Wand controllers and Knuckles.

Controllers connect through RF24, directly to the Headset or Receiver which then sends the controller data to PC via USB.
