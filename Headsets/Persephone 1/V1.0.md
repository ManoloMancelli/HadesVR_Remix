# Persephone 1.0 Headset

I've took a lot of inspiration from Sony's PlaystationVR while designing my own, DiY headset. 

I've called it "Persephone". A cheeky link to the HadesVR project name.

It's fully functional. Controllers work as well too.

You can get the STl files [Here](https://github.com/ManoloMancelli/HadesVR_Remix/tree/main/3D%20Prints/Persephone%201.0%20Headset)

# How does it work and what can it do?

The headset connects to the PC via USB and receives rotation and button data from both controllers wirelessly, while the tracking is done outside-in using Playstation Move Cameras and [PSMoveServiceEX](https://github.com/psmoveservice/PSMoveService).

You can use the setup in: 
* Headset and controllers mode - Headset + Controllers + PSMoveServiceEX Tracking - 6DoF
* Headset only mode - Headset + PSMoveServiceEX - 6DoF
* Headset only mode - Headset - 3DoF
* Controllers only mode - Controllers + [Receiver](docs/RFReceiver.md) - 6DoF
